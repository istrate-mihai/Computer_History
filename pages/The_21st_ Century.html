                The next great advance in computing power came with the advent
                of the integrated circuit (IC). The idea of the integrated
                circuit was first conceived by a radar scientist working for the
                Royal Radar Establishment of the Ministry of Defence, Geoffrey
                W.A. Dummer. Dummer presented the first public description of an
                integrated circuit at the Symposium on Progress in Quality
                Electronic Components in Washington, D.C. on 7 May 1952.
              </p>

              <p>
                The first working ICs were invented by Jack Kilby at Texas
                Instruments and Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor.Kilby
                recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in
                July 1958, successfully demonstrating the first working
                integrated example on 12 September 1958.In his patent
                application of 6 February 1959, Kilby described his new device
                as "a body of semiconductor material ... wherein all the
                components of the electronic circuit are completely
                integrated".However, Kilby's invention was a hybrid integrated
                circuit (hybrid IC), rather than a monolithic integrated circuit
                (IC) chip.Kilby's IC had external wire connections, which made
                it difficult to mass-produce.

                Supercomputers in particular often have highly unique
                architectures that differ significantly from the basic
                stored-program architecture and from general purpose
                computers.They often feature thousands of CPUs, customized
                high-speed interconnects, and specialized computing hardware.
                Such designs tend to be useful only for specialized tasks due to
                the large scale of program organization required to successfully
                utilize most of the available resources at once. Supercomputers
                usually see usage in large-scale simulation, graphics rendering,
                and cryptography applications, as well as with other so-called
                "embarrassingly parallel" tasks.

                The first mobile computers were heavy and ran from mains power.
                The 50lb IBM 5100 was an early example. Later portables such as
                the Osborne 1 and Compaq Portable were considerably lighter but
                still needed to be plugged in. The first laptops, such as the
                Grid Compass, removed this requirement by incorporating
                batteries â€“ and with the continued miniaturization of computing
                resources and advancements in portable battery life, portable
                computers grew in popularity in the 2000s.The same developments
                allowed manufacturers to integrate computing resources into
                cellular mobile phones by the early 2000s.

                hese smartphones and tablets run on a variety of operating
                systems and recently became the dominant computing device on the
                market.These are powered by System on a Chip (SoCs), which are
                complete computers on a microchip the size of a coin.

              <h3>About Ethical Hacking</h3>
              <p>
                Hacking significantly affects the development of systems and
                networks. This is especially the case of systems and networks of
                organizations where sensitive or confidential information are
                used on a regular basis.
              </p>
              <p>
                Organizations must find solutions and measures to protect
                information technology assets. In this endeavor, organizations
                can use ethical hacking. Ethical hacking is a hacking role that
                business organizations can exploit for security purposes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ethical hacking presents advantages to increase the capabilities
                of organizations to protect their IT and information assets.
                Ethical hacking sheds a positive light on hacking. Nonetheless,
                any organization that implements ethical hacking must consider
                the potential negative impacts and issues arising from the
                practice.
