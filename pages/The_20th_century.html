                The development of electricity as a source of power preceded
                this conjunction with steam power late in the 19th century. The
                pioneering work had been done by an international collection of
                scientists including Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania,
                Alessandro Volta of the University of Pavia, Italy, and Michael
                Faraday of Britain. It was the latter who had demonstrated the
                nature of the elusive relationship between electricity and
                magnetism in 1831, and his experiments provided the point of
                departure for both the mechanical generation of electric
                current, previously available only from chemical reactions
                within voltaic piles or batteries, and the utilization of such
                current in electric motors.

                Nikola Tesla was an engineer and scientist known for designing
                the alternating-current (AC) electric system, which is the
                predominant electrical system used across the world today. He
                also created the "Tesla coil," which is still used in radio
                technology. Born in modern-day Croatia, Tesla came to the United
                States in 1884 and briefly worked with Thomas Edison before the
                two parted ways. He sold several patent rights, including those
                to his AC machinery, to George Westinghouse.

              <h2>Alan Turing & The Birth of Computer Technology</h2>
              <p>
                Today he is famous for being an eccentric yet passionate British
                mathematician, who conceived modern computing and played a
                crucial part in the Allied victory over Nazi Germany in WW2.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1936, Turing published a paper that is now recognised as the
                foundation of computer science. Turing analysed what it meant
                for a human to follow a definite method or procedure to perform
                a task. For this purpose, he invented the idea of a ‘Universal
                Machine’ that could decode and perform any set of instructions.
                Ten years later he would turn this revolutionary idea into a
                practical plan for an electronic computer, capable of running
                any program.
              </p>
              <p>
                After two years at Princeton, developing ideas about secret
                ciphers, Turing returned to Britain and joined the government’s
                code-breaking department. In July 1939, the Polish Cipher Bureau
                passed on crucial information about the Enigma machine, which
                was used by the Germans to encipher all its military and naval
                signals. After September 1939, joined by other mathematicians at
                Bletchley Park, Turing rapidly developed a new machine (the
                ‘Bombe’) capable of breaking Enigma messages on an industrial
                scale.
              </p>
              <p>
                Turing worked on other technical innovations during the war – in
                particular, a system to encrypt and decrypt spoken telephone
                conversations. Codenamed Delilah, it was successfully
                demonstrated using a recording of one of Winston Churchill's
                speeches, but was never used in action. However, it gave Turing
                hands-on experience of working with electronics, and led to a
                position at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), where he
                worked on what he sometimes described as an ‘electronic brain’.
              </p>
              <p>
                In March 1946 Turing produced a detailed design for what was
                called the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE.) This was a digital
                computer in the modern sense, storing programs in its memory.
                His report emphasised the unlimited range of applications opened
                up by this technological revolution, and software developments
                ahead of parallel American developments. Yet his relationship
                with NPL soured and he left in 1948, before a pilot version of
                the ACE was made in 1950.

              <h3>ENIAC</h3>
              <p>
                ENIAC (/ˈɛniæk/; Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)
                was the first programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital
                computer.It was Turing-complete, and able to solve "a large
                class of numerical problems" through reprogramming.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although ENIAC was designed and primarily used to calculate
                artillery firing tables for the United States Army's Ballistic
                Research Laboratory (which later became a part of the Army
                Research Laboratory),its first program was a study of the
                feasibility of the thermonuclear weapon.

                The Univac 1 is the first commercial computer to attract
                widespread public attention. Although manufactured by Remington
                Rand, the machine was often mistakenly referred to as “the IBM
                Univac." Univac computers were used in many different
                applications but utilities, insurance companies and the US
                military were major customers.

                A joint project of England’s Manchester University, Ferranti
                Computers, and Plessey, Atlas comes online nine years after
                Manchester’s computer lab begins exploring transistor
                technology. Atlas was the fastest computer in the world at the
                time and introduced the concept of “virtual memory,” that is,
                using a disk or drum as an extension of main memory. System
                control was provided through the Atlas Supervisor, which some
                consider to be the first true operating system.
