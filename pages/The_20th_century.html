            The development of electricity as a source of power preceded this
            conjunction with steam power late in the 19th century. The
            pioneering work had been done by an international collection of
            scientists including Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania, Alessandro
            Volta of the University of Pavia, Italy, and Michael Faraday of
            Britain. It was the latter who had demonstrated the nature of the
            elusive relationship between electricity and magnetism in 1831, and
            his experiments provided the point of departure for both the
            mechanical generation of electric current, previously available only
            from chemical reactions within voltaic piles or batteries, and the
            utilization of such current in electric motors.

            Nikola Tesla was an engineer and scientist known for designing the
            alternating-current (AC) electric system, which is the predominant
            electrical system used across the world today. He also created the
            "Tesla coil," which is still used in radio technology. Born in
            modern-day Croatia, Tesla came to the United States in 1884 and
            briefly worked with Thomas Edison before the two parted ways. He
            sold several patent rights, including those to his AC machinery, to
            George Westinghouse.

          <h2>Alan Turing & The Birth of Computer Technology</h2>
          <p>
            Today he is famous for being an eccentric yet passionate British
            mathematician, who conceived modern computing and played a crucial
            part in the Allied victory over Nazi Germany in WW2.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1936, Turing published a paper that is now recognised as the
            foundation of computer science. Turing analysed what it meant for a
            human to follow a definite method or procedure to perform a task.
            For this purpose, he invented the idea of a ‘Universal Machine’ that
            could decode and perform any set of instructions. Ten years later he
            would turn this revolutionary idea into a practical plan for an
            electronic computer, capable of running any program.
          </p>
          <p>
            After two years at Princeton, developing ideas about secret ciphers,
            Turing returned to Britain and joined the government’s code-breaking
            department. In July 1939, the Polish Cipher Bureau passed on crucial
            information about the Enigma machine, which was used by the Germans
            to encipher all its military and naval signals. After September
            1939, joined by other mathematicians at Bletchley Park, Turing
            rapidly developed a new machine (the ‘Bombe’) capable of breaking
            Enigma messages on an industrial scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            Turing worked on other technical innovations during the war – in
            particular, a system to encrypt and decrypt spoken telephone
            conversations. Codenamed Delilah, it was successfully demonstrated
            using a recording of one of Winston Churchill's speeches, but was
            never used in action. However, it gave Turing hands-on experience of
            working with electronics, and led to a position at the National
            Physical Laboratory (NPL), where he worked on what he sometimes
            described as an ‘electronic brain’.
          </p>
          <p>
            In March 1946 Turing produced a detailed design for what was called
            the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE.) This was a digital computer in
            the modern sense, storing programs in its memory. His report
            emphasised the unlimited range of applications opened up by this
            technological revolution, and software developments ahead of
            parallel American developments. Yet his relationship with NPL soured
            and he left in 1948, before a pilot version of the ACE was made in
            1950.

            ENIAC and other attempts for a general purpose electronic computer
          </h2>
          <p>
            ENIAC (/ˈɛniæk/; Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was
            the first programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital
            computer.It was Turing-complete, and able to solve "a large class of
            numerical problems" through reprogramming.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although ENIAC was designed and primarily used to calculate
            artillery firing tables for the United States Army's Ballistic
            Research Laboratory (which later became a part of the Army Research
            Laboratory),its first program was a study of the feasibility of the
            thermonuclear weapon.

            The Univac 1 is the first commercial computer to attract widespread
            public attention. Although manufactured by Remington Rand, the
            machine was often mistakenly referred to as “the IBM Univac." Univac
            computers were used in many different applications but utilities,
            insurance companies and the US military were major customers.

            A joint project of England’s Manchester University, Ferranti
            Computers, and Plessey, Atlas comes online nine years after
            Manchester’s computer lab begins exploring transistor technology.
            Atlas was the fastest computer in the world at the time and
            introduced the concept of “virtual memory,” that is, using a disk or
            drum as an extension of main memory. System control was provided
            through the Atlas Supervisor, which some consider to be the first
            true operating system.
