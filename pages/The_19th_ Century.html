              <p>
                Charles Babbage, (born December 26, 1791, London, England—died
                October 18, 1871, London), English mathematician and inventor
                who is credited with having conceived the first automatic
                digital computer.<br />
                The idea of mechanically calculating mathematical tables first
                came to Babbage in 1812 or 1813. Later he made a small
                calculator that could perform certain mathematical computations
                to eight decimals. Then in 1823 he obtained government support
                for the design of a projected machine, the Difference Engine,
                with a 20-decimal capacity. Its construction required the
                development of mechanical engineering techniques, to which
                Babbage of necessity devoted himself. In the meantime (1828–39),
                he served as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University
                of Cambridge.
              </p>

              <p>
                During the mid-1830s Babbage developed plans for the Analytical
                Engine, the forerunner of the modern digital computer. In that
                device he envisioned the capability of performing any
                arithmetical operation on the basis of instructions from punched
                cards, a memory unit in which to store numbers, sequential
                control, and most of the other basic elements of the present-day
                computer.
                <br />
                In 1843 Babbage’s friend mathematician Ada Lovelace translated a
                French paper about the Analytical Engine and, in her own
                annotations, published how it could perform a sequence of
                calculations, the first computer program. The Analytical Engine,
                however, was never completed. Babbage’s design was forgotten
                until his unpublished notebooks were discovered in 1937. Babbage
                lived and worked for over 40 years at 1 Dorset Street,
                Marylebone, where he died, at the age of 79, on 18 October 1871;
                he was buried in London's Kensal Green Cemetery. According to
                Horsley, Babbage died "of renal inadequacy, secondary to
                cystitis.

              />
              <p>
                The daughter of famed poet Lord Byron, Augusta Ada Byron,
                Countess of Lovelace — better known as "Ada Lovelace" — showed
                her gift for mathematics at an early age. She translated an
                article on an invention by Charles Babbage, and added her own
                comments. Because she introduced many computer concepts,
                Lovelace is considered the first computer programmer.<br />
                Around the age of 17, Ada met Charles Babbage. The pair became
                friends, and the much older Babbage served as a mentor to
                Lovelace. Through Babbage, Lovelace began studying advanced
                mathematics with University of London professor Augustus de
                Morgan.
              </p>

              <p>
                Lovelace was later asked to translate an article on Babbage's
                analytical engine that had been written by Italian engineer
                Luigi Federico Menabrea for a Swiss journal. She not only
                translated the original French text into English but also added
                her own thoughts and ideas on the machine. Her notes ended up
                being three times longer than the original article. Her work was
                published in 1843, in an English science journal. Lovelace used
                only the initials "A.A.L.," for Augusta Ada Lovelace, in the
                publication.<br />
                Lovelace's article attracted little attention when she was
                alive. In her later years, she tried to develop mathematical
                schemes for winning at gambling.<br />
                Lovelace died at the age of 36 on 27 November 1852, from uterine
                cancer probably exacerbated by bloodletting by her physicians.
                The illness lasted several months, in which time Annabella took
                command over whom Ada saw, and excluded all of her friends and
                confidants. Under her mother's influence, Ada had a religious
                transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous
                conduct and making Annabella her executor. She lost contact with
                her husband after confessing something to him on 30 August which
                caused him to abandon her bedside. She was buried, at her
                request, next to her father at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene
                in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire.

                Wilhelm Schickard, a German polymath, designed a calculating
                machine in 1623 which combined a mechanised form of Napier's
                rods with the world's first mechanical adding machine built into
                the base. Because it made use of a single-tooth gear there were
                circumstances in which its carry mechanism would jam. A fire
                destroyed at least one of the machines in 1624 and it is
                believed Schickard was too disheartened to build another.

                1801: In France, weaver and merchant Joseph Marie Jacquard
                creates a loom that uses wooden punch cards to automate the
                design of woven fabrics. Early computers would use similar punch
                cards.

                1890: Inventor Herman Hollerith designs the punch card system to
                calculate the 1880 U.S. census. It took him three years to
                create, and it saved the government $5 million. He would
                eventually go on to establish a company that would become IBM.
